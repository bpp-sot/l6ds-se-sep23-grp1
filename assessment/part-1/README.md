# Part 1

Present three elements that show your understanding of where and how programming can be used for data processing and analysis. A threshold of 50% is used as the pass level for each practical assessment, which are then averaged to determine the final grade.

These three elements should consist of:
- Element 1:  The Applied Task from either [topic 2](./topic-2-assignment.ipynb), [topic 3](./topic-3-assignment.ipynb), or [topic 4](./topic-4-assignment.ipynb).
- Element 2: The Applied Task from [topic 5](./topic-5-assignment.ipynb).
- Element 3: The Applied Task from [topic 8](./topic-8-assignment.ipynb).
